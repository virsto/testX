title: About this blog
---

This mockup was created to record some things I learned while learning Jekyll. While this blog has many posts detailing Jekyll and its 
components, it's not designed to be a step-by-step tutorial for using Jekyll. 

I designed this blog as a teaching tool first and foremost. The design is simple, clean, and responsive. I used 
[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/ "html5 boilerplate") and [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ "normalize.css") 
as my starting points and narrowed them down to what I considered to be the essentials. The menu is manually generated but 
is responsive and built on pure CSS. The HTML focuses on semantics and is built with accessibility in mind. The CSS is not based on 
any framework, and only contains what the blog needs, there are no layout grids or extra UI classes. SASS is used only for code syntax 
highlighting, and can be stripped out easily as it is imported into the main.css file. The file links to a custom
 [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/ "modernizr") library that isn't used in the final build but is available if you need it. I recommend replacing it with the Modernizr build of your choice. The entire blog was built to be customized as you wish, and not force you into any conventions or frameworks. Feel free to clone this repo and experiment and reuse the blog as you see fit.
